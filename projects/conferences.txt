1.1 Ana-Maria Castravet: Birational Geometry of Moduli Spaces of Stable Rational Curves. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I will report on joint work with Jenia Tevelev on the birational geometry of the Grothendieck-Knudsen moduli space of stable rational curves with n markings. We prove that for n large, this space is not a Mori Dream Space, thus answering a question of Hu and Keel.

1.2 Christopher Hacon: On the Boundedness of the Functor of KSBA Stable Varieties 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.2.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let X be a canonically polarized smooth n-dimensional projective variety over $\Bbb C$ (so that $ω_X$ is ample), then it is well-known that a fixed multiple of the canonical line bundle defines an embedding of X in projective space. It then follows easily that if we fix certain invariants of X, then X belongs to finitely many deformation types. Since canonical models are rarely smooth, it is important to generalize this result to canonically polarized n-dimensional projective varieties with canonical singularities. Moreover, since these varieties specialize to non-normal varieties it is also important to generalize this result to semi-log canonical pairs. In this talk we will explain a strong version of the above result that applies to semi-log canonical pairs.
This is joint work with C. Xu and J. McKernan

1.3 Jun-Muk Hwang: Cartan-Fubini Type Extension of Holomorphic Maps Preserving Webs of Rational Curves 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.3.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ with $dim X_1=dim X_2$ be two projective manifolds of Picard number 1 in projective space. Assume that both $X_1$ and $X_2$ are covered by lines. Let $\varphi:U_1→ U_2$ be a biholomorphic map between two connected Euclidean open subsets $U_1 ⊂ X_1$ and $U_2 ⊂ X_2$. Suppose that both $\varphi$ and $\varphi−1$ send pieces of lines to pieces of lines. We show that $\varphi$ can be extended to a biregular morphism $\varphi:X_1→ X_2$. This was proved by Hwang-Mok in 2001 when the indices of $X_1$ and $X_2$ are bigger than 2 and the new result is when the indices are 2. In this case, the covering family of lines form webs of rational curves. We exploit the monodromy of the webs of lines to extend the holomorphic map.

1.4 Robert Lazarsfeld: Syzygies and Ganality of Algebraic Curves 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

1.4.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Mark Green and I conjectured in the mid-1980s that one could read off the gonality of an algebraic curve C from its syzygies in the embedding defined by any one sufficiently positive line bundle. Ein and I recently observed that a small variant of the ideas used by Voisin in her work on canonical curves leads to a surprisingly quick proof of this statement. I will discuss the conjecture and its proof.

1.5 Diane Maclagan: Tropical Schemes 
-------------------------------------

1.5.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Tropicalization replaces a variety by a polyhedral complex that is a “combinatorial shadow” of the original variety. This allows algebraic geometric problems to be attacked using combinatorial and polyhedral techniques. While this idea has proved surprisingly effective over the last decade, it has so far been restricted to the study of varieties and algebraic cycles. I will discuss joint work with Felipe Rincon, building on work of Jeff and Noah Giansiracusa, to understand tropicalizing schemes, and more generally the concept of a tropical scheme.

1.6 Mircea Mustata: The Decomposition Theorem for Toric Maps 
-------------------------------------------------------------

1.6.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The connections between the topology of toric varieties and combinatorics have been much studied. In this talk I will discuss the Decomposition Theorem in the context of toric maps and a combinatorial invariant that comes out of these considerations. This is based on joint work with Marc de Cataldo and Luca Migliorini.

1.7 Karl Schwede: Inversion of Adjunction for Rational and Du Bois Pairs 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.7.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We prove a new inversion of adjunction statement for rational and Du Bois singularities. Roughly speaking, this says that if we have a family over a smooth base with Du Bois special fiber and generic fiber with rational singularities, then the total space also has rational singularities.

Furthermore, we even generalize this result to the context of rational and Du Bois pairs as defined by Kollár and Kovács. Imprecisely, a pair (X,D) is Du Bois if the failure of X to be Du Bois is equal to the failure of D to be Du Bois. In order to accomplish our inversion of adjunction result we need to generalize, for pairs, many recent results on Du Bois singularities. I will describe some of these ideas. This is joint work with Sandor Kovács.

1.8 Chenyang Xu: Nonexistence of Asymptotical GIT Compactification 
-------------------------------------------------------------------

1.8.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Joint with Xiaowei Wang) By comparing different stability notions and the related invariants, we show that there exists families of canonically polarized manifolds, e.g., hypersurfaces in $\Bbb P^3$, which don’t have asymptotical Chow semistable limits. This implies that unlike Giesker and Mumford’s result in the curve case, in higher dimension, the method of using asymptotic chow stability to construct moduli space of canonically polarized manifolds doesn’t yield a natural compactification.

2.1 Donu Arapura  A new class of surfaces with maximal Picard number. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------

2.1.1 Absract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I will talk about some joint work with Partha Solapurkar, where we construct a class
of surfaces with maximal Picard number (i.e. $ρ=h^{11}$). Although most of these examples have
general type, they are built from elliptic modular surfaces. If time  permits, I will discuss some related things.

2.2 Paolo Aluffi:   Segre classes of monomial schemes. 
-------------------------------------------------------

2.2.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several invariants of singularities may be expressed in terms of
Segre classes, a key ingredient in Fulton-MacPherson intersection theory.
We will quickly review several applications of Segre classes, and
present a formula computing them for schemes that are `monomial' with
respect to a collection of possibly singular hypersurfaces meeting along
complete intersections. The formula is expressed as a formal integral
over a Newton polytope associated with the scheme.

2.3 Ludmill Katzarov: Categorical base loci and applications. 
--------------------------------------------------------------

2.3.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this talk we will introduce the notion of categorical base loci.
Examples and applications will be considered.

2.4 Chiu-Chu Melissa Liu:  Gromov-Witten invariants of toric Calabi-Yau 3-orbifolds. 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.4.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The remodeling conjecture proposed by Bouchard-Klemm-Marino-Pasquetti relates Gromov-Witten invariants of a toric Calabi-Yau 3-manifold/3-orbifold to Eynard-Orantin invariants of the mirror curve of the toric Calabi-Yau 3-fold. In this talk, I will describe results on this conjecture based on joint work with Bohan Fang and Zhengyu Zong.

2.7 Rita Pardini: Bi/trielliptic curves of genus 2 and stable Godeaux surfaces. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.7.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 We describe the stable  bi/trielliptic curves of genus 2,
namely the stable curves $C$ of genus 2 such that there exist finite
maps $f:C→ E_1$ and $g:C→ E_2$ of degrees respectively 2 and 3. We
apply this result to describe one of the three possible types  of
Gorenstein stable non-normal Godeaux  surfaces (a stable Godeaux surface
is a stable surface with $K^2=χ=1$).
This is joint work with M. Franciosi and S. Rollenske

2.8 Giulia Saccà:  Singularities of moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces and Nakajima quivers varieties 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.8.1 Abstract 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The aim of this talk is to study a class of singularities of
moduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces by means of Nakajima quiver
varieties. The singularities in question arise from the choice of a
non generic polarization, with respect to which we consider stability,
and admit natural symplectic resolutions corresponding to choices of
general polarizations. By establishing the stability of the
Lazarsfeld-Mukai bundle for some class of rank zero sheaves on a K3
surface, we show that these moduli spaces are, locally around a
singular point, isomorphic to a quiver variety in the sense of
Nakajima and that, via this isomorphism, the natural symplectic
resolutions correspond to variations of GIT quotients of the quiver
varieties. This is joint work with E. Arbarello.
