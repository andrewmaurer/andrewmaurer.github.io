<h2>About Andrew</h2>
<ul>
	<li> I'm a first year PhD student in the <a href="http://www.math.uga.edu">mathematics</a> department at <a href="http://www.uga.edu">University of Georgia</a>.  My <a href="research.html">research</a> interest lies mainly in the realm of algebraic geometry.  I recently (May 2014) finished a BS in <a href="http://www.math.umass.edu">mathematics</a> from <a href="http://www.umass.edu">University of Massachusetts, Amherst</a>.</li>
	<li> I'm originally from Burlington, Massachusetts, and graduated from Burlington High School in 2010. Growing up, I participated in many plays and musicals with the high school and Burlington Players. Additionally, I was on the tennis team and took courses at Baypath College through the high school's dual enrollment program.  I also attended and later worked at <a href="http://urjnecamps.org">Eisner camp</a> and was on staff for <a href="http://eisnercranelake.urjcamps.org/chazak/">Camp Chazak</a> for three years.</li>
	<li> My hobbies include biking, playing mandolin, and cooking (and eating!) vegetarian food.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Good Books</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Fiction:</b> <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> (Martin), <em>Lolita</em> (Nabokov), <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</em> (Adams)</li>
	<li><b>Nonfiction:</b> <em>The Man Who Loved Only Numbers</em> (Hoffman), <em>A Civil Action</em> (Harr), <em>G&#246;del Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid</em> (Hofstadter), <em>I am a Strange Loop</em> (Hofstadter)</li>
	<li><b>Mathematics:</b> <em>A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory</em> (Ireland and Rosen),  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Good Software</h2>

I run GNU-Linux, and am interested in free / open source software.  I'll post my recommendations here.

<ul>
	<li><b>Linux Distro:</b> I currently run <a href="http://www.fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a>.  In the past I've ran <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> and <a href="http://www.archlinux.org">Arch Linux</a>.  I'd still be running Arch, but it turns having a computer into a full time hobby.</li>
	<li><b>Productivity tools:</b> I've recently discovered <a href="http://www.orgmode.org">Org Mode</a>, a plugin for emacs (it probably came with your emacs installation).  Org Mode stores your data (notes, to-do lists, anything really) in easy-to-format text files.  It supports collapsible views and exports to ASCII, HTML, and LaTeX.  It also has LaTeX support, which is a big plus.  Essentially, it makes not-taking on a computer possible for mathematicians.</li>
	<li><b>Mathematical Computing:</b> Sage is awesome.  It's built on Python, and supports many mathematical programming languages, too (GAP and GP/Pari, to name two). The notebook interface is good, and you can also test out sage on <a href="http://www.sagenb.org">sage notebook</a> or <a href="http://www.sagemath.org">the sage project</a>.</li>
	<li><b>General Computing:</b> I've taken a liking to Python. It's definitely faster to code in than something like Java.  I'll update this after I do some more coding in Python.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Good Music</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Chris Thile</li>
	<li>David Grisman</li>
	<li>Paul Simon</li>
	<li>Tim O'brien (the mandolinist, not the author)</li>
	<li>The Grateful Dead</li>
</ul>
